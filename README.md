# HEMS
Home Energy Management System
HEMS is the public development of a Home Energy Management System by using standard available building blocks like Home Assistant or Node Red.
It is aimed to be used by ordinary people. So we're not asking people to learn how to program and take code and try to implement that. 
The aim is to really integrate stuff that works out of the box.
